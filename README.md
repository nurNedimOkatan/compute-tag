![Example Runs](https://github.com/craig-day/compute-tag/workflows/Example%20Runs/badge.svg)

A Github action to compute the next version tag.

This can be helpful to automatically compute tags and pipe them to the
[`create-release`](https://github.com/actions/create-release) action.

## Inputs

| Parameter           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Required | Default      |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| `github_token`      | A Github token, usually `${{ github.token }}`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Y**    | N/A          |
| `tag`               | The tag to compute the next version of. If not specified, the most recent tag in the repo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | N        | Latest       |
| `branch`            | The branch to find compute the tag for. This requires iteration of all tags for the repo and the commits for the branch to find a tag for a commit on the branch. For large repositories this can be very slow. It is highly recommended that `github_token` be supplied to prevent rate limit errors when searching. | N        | N/A          |
| `version_scheme`    | One of (`continuous`, `semantic`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | N        | `semantic`   |

**Create a GitHub Release for each push to `master`**

> NOTE: Since `actions/create-release` is deprecated, this example uses [`softprops/action-gh-release`](https://github.com/softprops/action-gh-release)
> which maintains a similar API and feature set.

          version_scheme: semantic
